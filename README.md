**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
The intention behind this app was to create a weight-tracking platform featuring a minimum of three screens: Login, daily weight view, and weight entry. It aimed to cater to users interested in setting and pursuing personal weight goals. Although the design phase of the app was successfully concluded, I encountered time constraints that prevented the completion of the development process. Nevertheless, both the design and the App Release Plan are well-structured and robust.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
To cater to the user requirements of this application, I developed three primary screens for user interaction. These included the login screen, the daily weight display screen, and the weight entry screen. The login screen provided options for users to either log in to an existing account or create a new one within the app. On the Daily Weight screen, users could view a grid displaying each recorded weight entry for every day. Meanwhile, the Weight Entry screen featured a straightforward input box and save button, enabling users to edit existing entries or input new ones. The application's straightforward design and limited interactive elements ensure ease of comprehension and usage.


**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
In coding my app, I primarily utilized knowledge and techniques acquired from the course's ZyBooks material. This resource provided insights into effectively utilizing Android Studio for tasks such as designing accessible buttons, establishing a database, and implementing screen navigation within the app. These skills are transferable and can certainly be applied to any future development projects using Android Studio.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
To validate the code I composed, I conducted testing using the Android Studio debugger to ensure the proper functioning of each function. It is imperative to rigorously test every aspect of the application to guarantee its safety and security for users. For instance, during my initial testing phase, I discovered an issue where a comparison in my functions consistently resulted in a true outcome.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
I had to employ some ingenuity when utilizing the Android Studio layout editor to construct each of my application's layouts. The process of actually using the editor differs significantly from merely studying the components and their interrelations.


**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
I consider my achievement to be notably evident in formulating a well-structured release plan for my application. Drawing from my past professional experiences, I believe that my skills in this domain enabled me to establish effective and achievable objectives for the potential monetization and launch of my app.
